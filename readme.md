## Introduction

This report provides an overview of chatbots, their purpose, and their key features. It explores the fundamental aspects that define chatbots, including their applications and examples. Additionally, the report highlights common shortcomings that can negatively impact the user experience, offering insights into what makes a chatbot ineffective. By understanding these elements, readers can gain a deeper appreciation of chatbot technology and its challenges.

## What are chatbots?

According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/what-is-a-chatbot/), a chatbot is a **software application that simulates human conversation** through voice commands, text chats, or both. Chatbots are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies, enabling them to understand and respond to user queries in a conversational manner.

[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbot-design) claims there are two types of chatbots: **rule-based** and **AI-based**. Rule-based chatbots follow a set of **predefined rules** and can only respond to specific commands or keywords. They are limited in their ability to understand complex queries and often require users to follow a strict format. On the other hand, AI-based chatbots leverage **machine learning algorithms** and **natural language processing** to understand context, intent, and sentiment, allowing for more dynamic and human-like interactions.

## What makes a chatbot good?

According to IBM's [chatbot design practices](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chatbot-design), a good chatbot:

- features a UI that is **easy to use, responsive, engaging, and reflective of the brand**
- provide services in the right domain, such as instances where two-way conversations are needed
- balance short- and long-term business goals
- incorporates business process management and process mining to improve user experience and business outcomes

![Chatbots can negatively influence humans](./img/badchatbot.png "Chatbots can negatively influence humans")

[Listverse](https://listverse.com/2025/04/02/ten-disturbing-news-stories-involving-chatbots/) features ten disturbing news stories involving chatbots, including:

- [Man files complaint after ChatGPT falsely claimed he murdered his children](https://youtu.be/uP0E1icYKLw)
- [Michigan man speaks out after getting threatening message from Google AI chatbot](https://youtu.be/LEEyuFmTaJw)
- several stories involving Character.ai:
  - [Digital clones of deceased teenagers Molly Russell and Brianna Ghey appear on Character.AI](https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/digital-clones-deceased-teenagers-molly-russell-brianna-ghey-appear-characterai-1728127)
  - [AI Chatbot Encourages Teen to Kill Parents Over Screen Time Limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9KrjH9PSm0)
  - [Florida mother files lawsuit against Character.ai over son's death by suicide](https://youtu.be/LLdS1e5c6Ok)

These stories and their frequency demonstrate how chatbots can negatively influence humans as a result of their exact characteristic they receive so much praise for: the ability to simulate human conversation.

AI chatbots are constantly improving, but incidents such as the ones listed above are always a possibility. [OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8554982-how-should-i-report-a-gpt) allows users to flag or report GPTs created by other users. Despite the frequency and severity of incidents stemming from Character.AI, the service's UI does not feature any clear reporting features.
